# Lux Image Gen — Pitfalls Reference

## When to use
Load AFTER `image-gen-v2` when you're about to generate images for Lux. This skill contains production-failure learnings that the base skill doesn't capture.

## 🔴 P1: You MUST load image-gen-v2 first
**NEVER** write image prompts from general knowledge or intuition. The Lux style is highly specific: watercolor/ink, editorial metaphor, aged paper/sepia, approach rotator (A-G). Without loading the skill, you'll produce literal/iconic stock-photo-style images that the user will immediately reject.

**Rule:** Always `skill_view(name='image-gen-v2')` before any `image_generate` call.

## 🔴 P2: Section images go on the section dict, not the first item
The base skill's step 2h says "add `\"image\"` to lead or to **first item in each section**" — this is **incorrect**. The render.py template checks `sec["image"]` (the section dict itself):

```python
# render.py line 175-178
if sec.get("image"):
    section_image_html = f'<img src="{esc_attr(sec["image"])}" ...>'
```

**Correct:** Add `"image": "images/section_<slug>_<date_iso>.jpg"` directly to each section dict in the `edition.json` `sections` array.

**Verification:**
```bash
grep -o '"image": "[^"]*"' /tmp/v2/edition.json
# Expected: 1 lead + N section images
```

## 🔴 P3: Re-render wipes wire ticker — re-inject
After re-rendering, `index.html` is regenerated from scratch. The wire ticker is lost. Re-inject:

```bash
python3 scripts/inject_wire_ticker.py /tmp/v2/output/index.html /tmp/v2/scouts/scout_wire.json --output /tmp/v2/output/index.html
```

## 🔴 P4: Re-render also wipes podcast pill
Same as P3 — re-inject the podcast pill after re-render if applicable.

## 🔴 P5: Lead image filename must match edition.json
The lead image filename must be `lead_<date_iso>.jpg` (not `.png`). The `image` field in edition.json references `images/lead_<date_iso>.jpg`. If the xAI CDN returns a `.png`, convert or rename to `.jpg` when saving.
