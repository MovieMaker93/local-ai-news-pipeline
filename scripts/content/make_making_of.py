"""make_making_of.py — Build the "How this issue made itself" page.

Reads what the pipeline already left behind and turns it into a replayable
account of the run. Pure code: no LLM, no network, and strictly READ-ONLY on
pipeline state, so it can never affect the issue it is describing.

Sources, in order of trust:
  1. /tmp/lain/scouts/scout_*.json  — how much each scout actually returned
  2. /tmp/lain/logs/run_<date>.log  — which scouts failed, issue no, start/end
  3. mtimes of the per-step logs  — when each step finished (hence durations)
  4. /tmp/lain/edition.json         — what actually got published, and the lead

Counts come from the scout JSON files rather than the run log on purpose:
(robustness against future scouts invoked outside run_scout()).

Everything it prints is derived. Nothing is estimated or invented: if a number
can't be computed it is omitted rather than guessed.

Usage:
    python3 make_making_of.py <output.html> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
                             [--logs DIR] [--edition PATH]

Prints a one-line JSON status (same convention as render.py). Exit non-zero on
error — callers in run.sh treat this step as non-fatal.
